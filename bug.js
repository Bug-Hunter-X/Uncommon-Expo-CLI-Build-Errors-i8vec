This error typically occurs when you are using the Expo CLI to build your React Native application and encounter issues related to the build process, particularly when dealing with native modules or complex project configurations.  It often involves cryptic error messages that are hard to pinpoint directly in the Expo CLI output. The root cause is usually subtle misconfigurations within your project, dependencies, or the native code involved.  One example could be an incompatibility between a native module and the current Expo SDK version,  an incorrect setup of native dependencies, or a mismatch between your development environment and build environment.  Another potential cause might be related to issues with the Android or iOS build systems themselves.
